# Apex Override
A roguelite game where you seize control of funniest genes and species to battle a way up the ecological hierarchy.

---

## Information

**Project Title:** Apex Override
**Genre:** Roguelite  
**Platform:** PC

## Concept

- Bad news: you are a fragile, vulnerable, defenceless, unassuming amoeba cell.
- Good news: you have the ability to hijack the bodies of any beast you defeat.
- Bad news: you cannot take down even a helpless larva on your own.
- Good news: you don't fight fair—you have the potential to command a whole army.
- Bad news: you will never know what nightmare is waiting to crush you at the summit.
- Good news: you can harvest identified genetic codes to mutate your army into the craziest forms that Mother Nature has never invented.

Play as an **amoeba with mind control abilities**, build an army of powerful (or funny?) animals, **climb the food chain** while collecting unique genes and traits, and defeat legendary apex predators in this roguelite game where each run brings new strategic choices and discoveries.

## Core Elements

### 1. **Mind Control Mastery**
- Players don't directly fight; they control other creatures
- Strategic choice of which animals to mind control
- Balance between controlling many weak creatures vs. few powerful ones
- Build diverse armies with complementary abilities

### 2. **Ecosystem Progression**
- Start at the bottom of the food chain (microscopic level)
- Climb through distinct ecosystems, each with unique animal rosters
- Visual and mechanical escalation as you ascend
- Each ecosystem tells its own ecological story

### 3. **Bullet Hell Chaos**
- Dense, pattern-based projectile attacks reflecting animal behaviors
- Controlled creatures provide different defensive/offensive capabilities
- Environmental hazards that reflect natural ecosystem dangers
- Strategic positioning and army composition matter
