## Information

**Project Title:** Apex Override
**Genre:** Roguelite  
**Platform:** PC

## Concept

- Bad news: you are a fragile, vulnerable, defenceless, unassuming amoeba cell.
- Good news: you have the ability to hijack the bodies of any beast you defeat.
- Bad news: you cannot take down even a helpless larva on your own.
- Good news: you don't fight fair—you have the potential to command a whole army.
- Bad news: you will never know what nightmare is waiting to crush you at the summit.
- Good news: you can harvest identified genetic codes to mutate your army into the craziest forms that Mother Nature has never invented.

Play as an **amoeba with mind control abilities**, build an army of powerful (or funny?) animals, **climb the food chain** while collecting unique genes and traits, and defeat legendary apex predators in this roguelite game where each run brings new strategic choices and discoveries.
